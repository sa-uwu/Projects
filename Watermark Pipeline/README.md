# 🖼️ Watermark Pipeline

It all started one fine day when I was struggling to remove a watermark from an image I wanted to use. That’s when I thought, 
>**"if removing a watermark is this hard, how easy is it to apply one? 🤔"**

Organizations and individuals publish hundreds of photographs, diagrams, and visuals in their articles, and of course, they wouldn’t want someone like me to just reuse them so easily 😛. But then another question hit me:


>**How long does it take to watermark a single image?**  
10 minutes? 5 minutes? Maybe 3?  

I definitely would not want to spend that much time on one image, let alone hundreds of them 🤯. That is when the idea struck me:

And that is how this small project came to life 🚀.
