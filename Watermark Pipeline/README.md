# üñºÔ∏è Watermark Pipeline 

It all started one fine day when I was struggling to remove a watermark from an image I wanted to use. That‚Äôs when I thought, 
>**"if removing a watermark is this hard, how easy is it to apply one? ü§î"**
<br>

Organizations and individuals publish hundreds of photographs, diagrams, and visuals in their articles, and of course, they wouldn‚Äôt want someone like me to just reuse them so easily üòõ. But then another question hit me:


>**How long does it take to watermark a single image?**  
10 minutes? 5 minutes? Maybe 3?  

I definitely would not want to spend that much time on one image, let alone hundreds of them ü§Ø. 

That is when an idea struck me:

And that is how this small project came to life üöÄ.

## üìå Project Overview  

The **Watermark Pipeline** automates the process of applying watermarks to images.

- User needs to upload images through an APIGW to an S3 bucket.  

- As soon as an image is uploaded, the pipeline automatically triggers the Lambda Function to process the image and store back.

- Once the image is processed and uploaded, another Lambda is invoked that generates a predigned url and leverages SES to send it back to user via email. 

This automated workflow not only reduces the **time**, but it make the task **easy and scalable**, even for large volumes of images.

  <strong>Enough of talking. Let's get our hands dirty and build it together!</strong>
</p>

<br>


<br>

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

#### a. AWS Account
#### b. Access to following Services 
  *  Lambda
  *  API Gateway
  *  Simple Storage Service (S3)
  *  Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  *  EventBridge
  *  Simple Email Service (SES)
#### c. Email id (preferably two)

<br>

### 1. Creating an S3 Bucket 
---


For this project, we can either use **two separate S3 buckets** or create **two separate folders** within a single bucket.  

- The first location is for uploading the **raw images**.  
- The second location is for storing the **processed/final images**.  

In this project, we are using the **folder approach** within a single bucket for simplicity and easier management.
<br>

#### Refer the below image for S3 Bucket configuration

<br> 

#### Once the bucket is created, click the **'Create Folder'** button and create two folders named **'raw'** and **'final'**.

<br>

> ## üí° Fun Fact about S3 ##
>
> Amazon S3 is an **object storage service**, which means it does not have real folders or files.  
>
> Everything in S3 is treated as an **individual object**. For example:  
> - `final/test1.png` is an object with actual data  
> - `folder/` is just an empty object, with key name ending with ' / '
> 
> The `folder/file` hierarchy you see in the AWS console is just a **user-friendly representation**, designed to match how humans think about organizing data.

### 2. Configuring IAM Roles
<br>

IAM allows **users, services,** and **applications** to assume roles and perform specific actions on AWS resources.  

For this project, we need to configure IAM roles for both **Lambda** and **API Gateway**.  
<br>

- Create the IAM role for **API Gateway** as shown below:

  </p>

<br>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Best Practice Reminder**  
>
> In the real-world scenario, one should always follow the principle of **least-privilege**, and configure and grant fine-grained permissions that are absolutely necessary.
> 
>
<br>

* Following the principle of **least-privilege**, I have created a custom, fine-grained permission policy, which we will attach to the **API Gateway IAM role**.

  </p>
<br>

* **Custom Permission Policy**

``` JSON
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::us-east-1.bucketforimageupload/raw/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
<br>

Following similar steps, we will create an IAM Role for our **Lambda Functions**
