# ⚙️ Disclaimer

This Python code was not entirely developed by me. It was created with the help of OpenAI tools and refined through trial and error experimentation.

The project is intended for learning and demonstration purposes only to understand AWS Lambda, S3, and SES integrations.

By no means it is optimized for production use, as there may be loopholes, inefficiencies, or better architectural approaches to achieve the same functionality.

Thank you 🫡 for your kind attention to this matter.
